# Verilog Design Project

This repository contains the Verilog implementations of various digital logic components, including an Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU), single/dual clock FIFO, single/dual port RAM, and D latch. The project includes simulation, synthesis, and implementation using **Xilinx Vivado 2022.2**.

## Overview

This project aims to design and implement key digital components in Verilog using the **Xilinx Vivado 2022.2** tool. Each module is designed for optimal hardware performance and has undergone simulation and synthesis for validation.

## Design Blocks

1. **Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)**
   - A fully functional ALU capable of performing arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction) and logic operations (AND, OR, XOR).
   
2. **D FlipFlop**
   - A simple D-type FlipFlop for basic memory storage.
     
3. **Single and Dual Clock FIFO**
   - First-In-First-Out memory implemented for single and dual clock domains for efficient data buffering.
   
4. **Single and Dual Port RAM**
   - Block RAM designs for single and dual-port access for use in various memory-related applications.
   

## Simulation & Synthesis

Each design has been simulated and synthesized using **Xilinx Vivado 2022.2**. The following steps were followed for each module:

- **Simulation:** Verilog testbenches were created to verify the functional behavior of each module.
- **Synthesis:** Each design was synthesized to verify its hardware implementation and ensure optimal performance.
- **Implementation:** The designs were implemented and tested for FPGA compatibility.

## Requirements

- **Xilinx Vivado 2022.2** (or later)
- Basic knowledge of Verilog
- Optional: FPGA hardware for testing (e.g., Xilinx FPGA)
